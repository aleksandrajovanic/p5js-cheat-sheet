# Making a new translation!

I'm looking for help translating this cheat sheet into as many languages as possible! If you can assist, please reach out via in the issues tab or via the [p5.js forum post](https://discourse.processing.org/t/a-p5-js-cheat-sheet-for-beginners/8236/7)!

No worries! – Please respond to (or open) the associated language issue with the translations for each cheatsheet section and a contributor will implement and confirm them with you before pushing them live!

### If you are comfortable with HTML & making git pull requests:
+ clone the repository
+ navigate to the `docs` folder
+ copy `index.html` & rename to `langcode.html` (where langcode is the [ISO 639-1 code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) for the language you are translating.
+ make all translation changes inside of the  `<code class="language-javaScript"></code>` tags
+ make all translation changes to the `terms` JSON object at the bottom of the HTML page.
+ add your name as the translator + a link to yourself in the `<footer>` section
+ make a pull request against the repository!

#### update the menu:
+ in the `docs` folder, find the `menu.js` file and add a link to the translation page

#### add a pdf:
+ export a pdf and add to the root (print to PDF in *^chrome*), please name it `p5cheatsheet-▵LC.pdf`
+ verify that it will all fit on one page, if there is overflow, some minor custom CSS may need to be implemented.

*^it's critical that it's in chrome, for best rendering and color accuracy*.

*▵ the LC here refers to Language Code, please use the appropriate [ISO 639-1 code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) for the language you are translating*
